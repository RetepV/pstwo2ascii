My rendition of Jim Brain/RETRO Innovations PS2Encoder

I decided to add a "Real" RS-232 V24 interface, as most vintage computers cannot work with 0V/5V, but need positive and negative voltages. Also, some old vintage computer output +12V and -12V, and wil for sure blow up the ATMEGA's ports.

I decided to make it in SMD, to keep the boards small. Of course the connectors mostly dictate the final size of the board, and t.b.h. I think that if I had used PTH components, the board would not be much larger.

Note: this is a WIP and has not been tested yet, not even created yet.
